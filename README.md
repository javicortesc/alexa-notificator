# Alexa Notifications System

## Project Description
The Alexa Notifications System is designed to enable seamless communication between a custom web server and Alexa devices. Users can interact with the web server to update their status (boolean flags), which are then automatically communicated to other users via Alexa skill notifications.

## Project Scope
1. **Web Server**:
   - Users can log in securely using their credentials.
   - Within the web server, users can manage pre-defined status flags, such as "On the way," "Already ate," or "Using public transport."

2. **Alexa Integration**:
   - A custom Alexa skill will be developed to receive flag updates from the web server.
   - Notifications will be sent to Alexa devices to inform other users about status changes.

3. **Notifications**:
   - Notifications will be clear and contextual, such as: 
     - "User has indicated they are on the way."
     - "User has indicated they are using public transport."

## Key Features
1. Secure login for users on the web server.
2. Management and real-time updates of boolean flags.
3. Real-time communication between the web server and Alexa skill.
4. Automatic notifications on Alexa devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Django/Flask (Python) or Express.js (Node.js)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Alexa Skill**: AWS Lambda, Alexa Skills Kit (ASK)
- **Notifications**: Alexa Notifications API, AWS SNS (optional)

## Project Structure
1. **Web Server**:
   - `app/`: Source code for the web server.
   - `static/`: Static assets (CSS, JavaScript).
   - `templates/`: HTML templates.

2. **Alexa Skill**:
   - `lambda/`: Code for the AWS Lambda function.
   - `intents/`: Intents and interaction models for Alexa skill.

## How It Works
1. Users log into the web server and update their status.
2. The web server sends status updates to the Alexa skill.
3. The Alexa skill processes these updates and sends notifications to the intended recipients.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for more complex user actions and notifications.
- Implement localization for multiple languages.
- Enable advanced reporting and analytics on user activity.
